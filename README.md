# blurred-mode-by-openCV
I made a black mask with the same shape as the video, then I added a white rectangle on it with the dimensions I want it to appear in the original from the original video, then I made a mirror mask to apply it to the blurred image and the first one to the original image, then I take the results of the two groups and add them to each other
## NOTE
You can find a video of the run *__"blurring.mp4"__*, and there is a *__"requirements.txt"__* do not forget it and you can find the video that I used *__"Portrait Mode with blurring.mp4"__*
